🌐 Multi-Cloud Architecture Demo
This project demonstrates a basic multi-cloud architecture setup where services interact across two cloud platforms, showcasing interoperability in a distributed cloud system. The frontend is hosted on one platform (e.g., local server or AWS/GCP), and the backend uses Firebase Realtime Database as a lightweight, scalable backend service.

✅ Project Objective
The primary goal of this task is to simulate and visualize a basic multi-cloud integration, where frontend services hosted in one cloud environment fetch and display data from a backend hosted in another cloud platform.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 & CSS3 – For building the frontend interface.
JavaScript (Fetch API) – To make API requests and retrieve data from Firebase.
Firebase Realtime Database – Serves as the cloud-hosted backend database.
Live Server / Python HTTP Server – To run the project locally without CORS issues.
🔗 Firebase Backend URL
The project fetches data from the following Firebase Realtime Database endpoint:

https://cloud-backend-task3-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/message.json

Ensure this endpoint is accessible publicly by updating your Firebase database rules.

⚙️ How It Works
The HTML page is opened using a local server (not directly as a file:/// path).
A fetch request is made to the Firebase Realtime Database.
The Firebase backend responds with a message.
The frontend dynamically displays the message on the page.
